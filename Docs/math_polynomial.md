# Roots and Optimization
Root finding refers to the general problem of searching for a solution of an equation F(x)=0 for some function F(x). This is a very general problem and it comes up a lot in mathematics! For example, if we want to optimize a function f(x) then we need to find critical points and therefore solve the equation f'(x)=0.

## Quadratic equation
> ax^2 + bx + c = 0  

Solving the quadratic equation:
* Quadratic formula
* factoring (direct factoring, grouping, AC method)
* etc

### Quadratic Formula
#### Finding the Roots(zeros)
> x1,x2 = (-b +- sqr(D))/2a

#### Discriminant
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation#Discriminant

To find the discriminant of:  
> ax^2 + bx + c = 0  

> D = b^2 - 4ac

## Newton's method, also known as the Newton–Raphson method

Newton's method is a root finding method that uses linear approximation. In particular, we guess a solution x0 of the equation f(x)=0, compute the linear approximation of f(x) at x0 and then find the x-intercept of the linear approximation.

## Horners method/rule

> 2\*3^3-6\*3^2+2\*3-1 = 5

> 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 1 = 5



Uses:
* very quickly solve polynomial equations
* factorization of polynomials (ru: разложение многочлена на множители/факторизация многочленов)
